## Overview
`RCNN.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that implements Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) for object detection and classification. This project demonstrates how to use RCNN for detecting and localizing objects in images with high accuracy.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- RCNN-based object detection
- Visualization of detection results
- Model training and evaluation examples

## File Description
- **RCNN.ipynb**: The main notebook that contains the full workflow, including data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this project.
2. Install the required dependencies (see below).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run `RCNN.ipynb`.
